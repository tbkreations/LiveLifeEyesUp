                    Did you know that 40% of people are addicted to their cellphones? Some of the issues Live Life Eyes Up hopes to solve are distracted driving, failing to appreciate the world around you, and cell phone addiction. Live Life Eyes Up was introduced by Howard Kutler, (Central graduate of 1974) and brought to fruition by Central High DECA marketing students.<br><br>We would now like to pass on our resources to you and your community, school or organization and make it possible for you to do your own Live Life Eyes Up campaign.  Under the resources tab of livelifeeyesup.org are the materials we used.  You can download them to make them your own, drop your own school/organization colors into the logo, and put your own pictures on the postcard of your members living life eyes up.  Sponsor events and activities that make it possible to Live Life Eyes Up.
